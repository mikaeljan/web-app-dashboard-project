## Live [demo](https://mikaeljan.github.io/web-app-dashboard-project/)

## To-Do:
1. Display at least two notifications when the user clicks the alerts icon
This could be a pop-up window or dropdown menu.
2. Traffic chart widget
 Create a navigation similar to the one in the mockup to display different data when the Hourly, Daily, Weekly and Monthly button is selected. Add functionality to the Hourly, Daily, Weekly and Monthly buttons so that a different line chart is displayed on click.
3. Add an "autocomplete" feature for the "Search for User" box, listing names that match the search term.
4. ~~Use local storage to save the settings.
When page is reloaded the settings are remembered.~~
5. ~~Add sweetAlert plugin functionality.~~
